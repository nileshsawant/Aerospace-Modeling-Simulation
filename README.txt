Please go to "Branches" and select an approprite topic to view and contribute code.
Contributors can also submit their code from a different topic and an appropriate
branch will be created for the same.

You may require Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib to run codes. No code uses SciPy as of 
now but it might be required later.

Contributors are free to use any additional module as long as it is freely available
and compatible with Python 3.
